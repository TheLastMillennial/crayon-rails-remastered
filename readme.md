# Crayon Rails Remastered

### History
I spend a good many hours playing crayon rail games as a kid. Unfortunately, my family lost our game and couldn't buy a replacement because it was out of print and used games cost over a hundred dollars. Years later when I stumbled upon a barely used (perhaps original edition) of the game, I felt obligated to preserve it. I've spent over a month remastering the game so I can enjoy playing it with my friends again!

## Folders

### Map: 
I have manually repaired crease marks, scratches, and other damage. This should be 27.75" by 22" at about 600 dpi.

### Loads:
I have vectorized the loads so the can be scaled to any size. The 'woods' load kept looking like a blob so I replaced it with my own version of a tree. I have provided a loads-reference.jpg image so it's clear which parts of the load need to be filled in.

### Cards:
These were the most time consuming, requiring days of manual adjustments. I might repair some of the damaged load icons later but they're legible enough it's not a priority. I've included the original card back as well as a custom one I made from scratch.

### Guides:
For now this is just contains a reference guide that shows which cities carry a specific load. I made this from scratch and I regret it because when I was nearly done, Word started crashing every 5 minutes.
