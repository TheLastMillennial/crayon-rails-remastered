# Crayon Rails Remastered

### History
I spent a good many hours playing crayon rail games as a kid. Unfortunately, my family lost our game and couldn't buy a replacement because it was out of print and used games cost over a hundred dollars. Years later when I stumbled upon a barely used (perhaps original edition) of the game, I felt obligated to preserve it. I've spent over a month remastering the game so I can enjoy playing it with my friends again!

## Folders

### Map: 
I have manually repaired crease marks, scratches, and other damage. This should be 27.75" by 22" at about 600 dpi.

### Loads:
I have vectorized the loads so the can be scaled to any size. The 'woods' load kept looking like a blob, so I replaced it with my own version of a tree. I have provided a loads-reference.jpg image so it's clear which parts of the load need to be filled in.

### Cards:
These were the most time-consuming, requiring days of manual adjustments. I might repair some of the damaged load icons later but they're legible enough, it's not a priority. I've included the original card back as well as a custom one I made from scratch.

### Guides:
This contains the rules and a reference guide showing which cities carry a specific load. The guide was a pain to make because just as I was finishing, Word started crashing every time I modified the table.

### Money:
The money is at 600 dpi and should be 4" by 1.75" with a .12" boarder.
 - 1  million dollars: 62
 - 5  million dollars: 31
 - 25 million dollars: 31
